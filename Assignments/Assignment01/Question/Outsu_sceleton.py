    Binarises the image using a global threshold `th`. Uses Otsu's method
    to find optimal thrshold value if the threshold variable is None. The
    returned image will be in the form of an 8-bit unsigned integer array
    with 255 as white and 0 as black.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    image : np.ndarray
        Image to binarise. If this image is a colour image then the last
        dimension will be the colour value (as RGB values).
    th : numeric
        Threshold value. Uses Otsu's method if this variable is None.

    Returns:
    --------
    binarised : np.ndarray(dtype=np.uint8)
        Image where all pixel values are either 0 or 255.
