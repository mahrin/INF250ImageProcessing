# Image Processing Assignment – Exercise 1

This exercise works on the image **`soccerteam.jpeg`**, which is blurry and requires sharpening and edge detection.

---

## Part (a) – Image Sharpening (12p)
- **Task:** Sharpen the image `soccerteam.jpeg`.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Description of the sharpening technique(s) used (4p).
  - Demonstration of the result (before vs. after) (5p).
  - Python script or pseudocode for ImageJ (4p).

---

## Part (b) – Canny Filter (13p)
- **Tasks:**
  - Explain briefly what a Canny filter is (3p).
  - Identify which result corresponds to the sharpened vs. original image (2p).
  - Apply the Canny filter on both original and sharpened images with **3 different sigma values** (4p).
  - Discuss your observations (included in results).
  - Provide resulting images and script/pseudocode (3p).

## Notes
- All images (`soccerteam.jpeg`, sharpened output, and Canny results) should be included in the repo.
- Python scripts or ImageJ pseudocode must be provided in a separate file or notebook.
- Clearly label images for comparison.
