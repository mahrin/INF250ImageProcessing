# Exercise – Coffee Beans & Cloves Image Processing

We will work on the image **`coffeebeans.jpeg`** (plate with coffee beans and cloves).  
The goal is to handle shadows, create masks, count only coffee beans, and extract positions/sizes.  

---

### Part (a) – Shadow Removal (5p)
- Apply image processing techniques to eliminate shadows.  
- Describe the methods and explain how they work.  
- Show intermediate and final results.  

---

### Part (b) – Masking (5p)
- Create a mask for coffee beans and cloves.  
- Generate two images:  
  1. With shadows included  
  2. Without shadows  

---

### Part (c) – Coffee Bean Selection (5p)
- Make a selection so that **only coffee beans** are counted (exclude cloves).  

---

### Part (d) – Position Extraction (5p)
- Create a list of **center (x, y) positions** of all coffee beans.  

---

### Part (e) – Size Estimation (5p)
- Compute the **size of coffee beans**.  
- Explain how this can be done and/or why it is challenging.
